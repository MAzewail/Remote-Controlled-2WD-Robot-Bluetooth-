## Project Overview

The Remote Controlled 2WD Robot (Bluetooth) is designed to provide a wireless control interface for a 2WD robot. It utilizes Bluetooth communication to establish a connection between the robot and a mobile device or computer. You can control the movement of the robot remotely by sending commands over the Bluetooth connection.

## Features

- Two-wheel drive robot with remote control capability.
- Bluetooth communication for wireless control.
- Control the robot's movement using a mobile device or computer.

## Hardware Requirements

To set up and run this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- Arduino or compatible microcontroller board.
- Two DC motors for the 2WD robot.
- Motor driver module (e.g., L298N) to control the motors.
- Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05 or HC-06) for wireless communication.
- Jumper wires for circuit connections.
- Breadboard or PCB for assembling the circuit.

## Circuit Diagram
